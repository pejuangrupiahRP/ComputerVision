🎯 Shape & Object Explorer – Interactive Learning App
📚 Background
The rapid advancement of computer technology and artificial intelligence—particularly in computer vision—has enabled countless innovative applications.
One of the core capabilities of computer vision is the ability to automatically recognize and interpret shapes from visual data, whether from static images or live video streams.

Shape detection plays a crucial role in digital image analysis with applications in:

🏭 Manufacturing (quality inspection)

🎥 Automated surveillance systems

🤖 Robotics (navigation and interaction)

🧩 Pattern recognition

🏫 Educational tools

This project demonstrates a real-time shape detection system using OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once), Next.js, and Python to identify basic geometric shapes such as:

🔺 Triangle

🔳 Square

🗾 Rectangle

🔸 Circle

⭐ Star

🥚 Oval

The system supports input from a live webcam feed and features a child-friendly web interface with gamified elements to enhance the learning experience.

🎮 Key Features
🌟 Interactive Web Interface
Kid-friendly design with bright colors and engaging animations

Real-time camera feed with a clearly defined scan area

Intuitive controls with large, easy-to-use buttons

🎯 Gamification System
Score system – Earn points for each detected shape and saved image

Streak counter – Track consecutive detections for bonus points

Daily challenges – Missions like “Circle Hunter” and “Shape Master”

Achievement system – Unlock badges to encourage continued learning

Progress tracking – View learning statistics over time

🔊 Audio & Visual Effects
Sound effects for detections, saves, and achievements

Celebration animations when reaching milestones

Colorful visual feedback to increase user engagement

📚 Educational Content
Fun facts about each geometric shape

Easy-to-understand explanations in Bahasa Indonesia (customizable)

Visual flashcards with definitions and trivia

⚖️ Scope & Limitations
Supported Shape Types
Currently supports basic geometric shapes: triangle, square, rectangle, circle, star, and oval.
Detection of complex or irregular shapes is not yet implemented.

Lighting & Environmental Conditions
Detection accuracy may be affected by:

Extreme lighting (too bright/dark)

High noise or poor camera resolution

Complex or cluttered backgrounds

Browser Compatibility
Requires a modern browser that supports WebRTC for camera access.

🎯 Objectives
💡 Implement shape detection algorithms using OpenCV, YOLO, and Python

📷 Accept image input from a webcam or live camera

🏷️ Annotate detected shapes with:

Colored bounding boxes

Shape name labels (e.g., "Circle", "Rectangle")

🎮 Provide a fun and engaging learning experience for children

📊 Track learning progress using points and achievements

🌟 Benefits
🎓 Interactive Learning
Turns passive observation into active exploration and engagement.

🔎 Discovery-Based Learning
Encourages users to find and recognize shapes in their environment.

🎮 Gamified Education
Score-based gameplay makes learning enjoyable and goal-driven.

👶 Child-Friendly Interface
Designed for young learners with attractive visuals and simple interaction.

✅ Result
This application allows users to explore and recognize shapes in their surroundings using a webcam or mobile camera.
Powered by computer vision, the system automatically detects shapes like triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, stars, and ovals in real time.

Detected shapes will:

🖼️ Be highlighted on screen with colored bounding boxes

🏷️ Be labeled with their shape names

🎯 Appear in the recent detection panel

📸 Be saved into a collection gallery

Delivering an educational experience that is both engaging and enjoyable!
