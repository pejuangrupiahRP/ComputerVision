🔍 Shape Detection in Objects
📚 Background
The rapid advancement of computer technology and artificial intelligence—particularly in the field of computer vision—has unlocked countless innovative applications. One fundamental aspect of computer vision is the ability to automatically recognize and interpret shapes from visual data, whether static images or live video streams.

Shape detection plays a crucial role in digital image analysis, with widespread applications ranging from:

🏭 Manufacturing (quality inspection)

🎥 Automated surveillance systems

🤖 Robotics (navigation and interaction)

🧩 Pattern recognition

🏫 Educational tools

This project focuses on building a real-time shape detection system using OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and Python to identify basic geometric shapes like triangle 🔺, square 🟥, rectangle 🟦, and circle 🟠. The system supports both static image files and live webcam feeds, enabling interactive shape identification without the need to manually upload files.

🚧 Scope & Limitations
Detected Shape Types:
The system is limited to detecting basic geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. More complex or irregular shapes are not covered in the current version.

Lighting & Environmental Conditions:
System performance may be affected by:

Extreme lighting (too bright or too dark)

High image noise

Complex or cluttered backgrounds

🎯 Objectives
💡 Implement a shape detection algorithm using OpenCV and Python that can identify basic geometric shapes in digital images.

📷 Enable the system to accept input from two sources:

Static image files

Live webcam streams

🏷️ Visually mark detected shapes with bounding outlines and shape name labels on the output display (both images and real-time video).

🌟 Benefits
🎓 More Interactive Learning:
Using real-time camera input turns passive learning into an engaging and exploratory experience.

🔎 Exploration-Based Learning:
Encourages users to actively search and identify shapes in their surroundings, promoting hands-on discovery.
