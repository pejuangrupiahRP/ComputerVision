The rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of computer vision, has opened up innovative opportunities across various applications. 
One fundamental aspect of computer vision is the ability to automatically recognize and understand object shapes from visual data, whether in the form of static images or video. Shape detection 
is crucial in digital image analysis, with wide-ranging applications including manufacturing (quality inspection), automated surveillance systems, robotics (navigation and interaction), pattern recognition, and education.
A real-time shape detection syste using OpenCV and Python can identify shapes such as triangles, squares, circles, etc., from both images and live camera feeds, enabling immediate identification without the need to upload files.

Scope Limitations
•	Types of Shapes Detected: The current system focuses on detecting basic geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. Detection of more complex or irregular shapes may not yet be implemented.
•	Lighting and Environmental Conditions: System performance may be affected by extreme lighting conditions (too bright or too dark), significant image noise, or complex backgrounds.

Objectives
•	To implement a shape detection algorithm using the OpenCV library and Python programming language capable of identifying basic geometric shapes (triangle, square, rectangle, circle) from digital images.
•	To integrate the system’s capability to receive image input from two sources: static image files and live video stream from a webcam.
•	To annotate the detected shapes on the visual output (from both image files and live camera feed) with bounding lines and appropriate shape name labels.

Benefits
•	More Engaging and Interactive Learning: Using real-time camera input transforms passive learning into an active and exploratory experience.
•	Exploration- and Discovery-Based Learning: The application encourages users to actively search for and identify shapes in their surroundings.

As a result, this application enables users to interactively learn to recognize various object shapes in their environment through a device camera (webcam or smartphone camera). Leveraging computer 
vision technology, the application automatically detects shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, and others captured by the camera in real time. Detected shapes will be marked on the screen, 
accompanied by labels indicating their names.
